      'Slay Like a Mother, a book that Parade magazine named one of the “Top 10 life-changing self-help books of the year,” is the kick in the pants you need to destroy what’s holding you back so you can live the life you want. You need this book if: You are a people pleaser by day and an overthinker by night. The negative voice in your head is the meanest mean girl you know. You feel broken and believe you must hide that brokenness to be loved. You are tired. Like fall-down-after-ruing-a-marathon tired.',
